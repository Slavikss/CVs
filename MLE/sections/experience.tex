\subsection{{ML Tech Lead / Co-founder, Shperling AI}\hfill Apr 2024 -- May 2025}
\subtext{Startup: On-premise RAG solutions for enterprise clients}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item Architected and deployed three on-premise Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for enterprise clients (internal support, Swiss consulting, fintech with 1M+ users):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For internal support, implemented RAG pipeline with Qwen-32B as the core LLM and RAGAS for automated evaluation; achieved 95\% accuracy on internal metrics and robust performance on golden set benchmarks.
        \item All RAG deployments included strict SQL injection detection, safe database connection management, and query rate limiting for production safety.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Developed and productionized a text2SQL analytics pipeline for B2B retail:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used Qwen-32B for SQL generation, validated outputs on a golden set, and reduced analytics latency from 8h to 1h.
        \item Integrated SQL injection detection and secure DB connection logic to ensure safe execution in enterprise environments.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Built and managed an R&D team (5 junior ML engineers): organized Scrum sprints, technical reviews, and delivered 5+ custom RAG prototypes, one of which became the commercial product core.
\end{zitemize}
